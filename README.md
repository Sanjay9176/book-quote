## Overview

Book Quote Shorts is a modern, dark-themed Single Page Application (SPA) designed to deliver inspiring literature quotes in a quick, engaging, reel-like carousel format.

## Features

* **Auto-Play & Progress Bar** â€“ Quotes automatically advance every 3.75s with a smooth progress bar.

* **Book Gallery** â€“ Dedicated section featuring animated book cards with hover effects.
